Does knowing more about activist persecution make them more critical of elites, more likely to act, or more inclined to retreat? These questions lie at the heart of an experimental study we conducted with Indonesian youth, designed to explore the relationship between awareness, political trust, and civic engagement.</p><p>Through a simple but carefully structured experiment, we examined how a brief informational message about activist repression shaped young people’s attitudes. The results speak to broader dynamics unfolding across Indonesia—how trust varies by region, how past experience shapes future action, and why raising awareness alone may not be enough.</p></p><a href=/blog/exposure_experiment_civicspace/ class="mt-4 inline-block text-brandBlue hover:underline">Read More →</a></article><article class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-xl transition"><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800"><a href=/blog/inequality_democracy_indonesia/ class=hover:text-brandBlue>What Inequality Tells Us About Democracy in Indonesia?</a></h2><p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">January 30, 2024</p><p class=text-gray-700><p>I used to believe that inequality weakens democracy.

Since the majority of the global poor population lives in rural areas and depends on the agricultural sector for their livelihood, land reform can potentially help alleviate global poverty. According to a recent <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview>World Bank report</a>, agricultural development is one of the most powerful tools to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Implementing land reform can lead to growth in the agricultural sector, which has been demonstrated to be <a href=https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/700061468334490682/ending-poverty-and-hunger-by-2030-an-agenda-for-the-global-food-system>two to four times more effective in increasing the income of the poorest</a> compared to other sectors.</p></p><a href=/blog/why_land_reform_fails/ class="mt-4 inline-block text-brandBlue hover:underline">Read More →</a></article><article class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-xl transition"><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800"><a href=/blog/social_life_rubber/ class=hover:text-brandBlue>The Social Life of Rubber</a></h2><p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">November 5, 2021</p><p class=text-gray-700><p>Natural rubber remains an important global commodity despite the increasing consumption of its synthetic counterpart. Rubber is native to the Amazonian rainforest, it was smuggled to Britain in 1876 and massively cultivated in Southeast Asian plantations from then to now. The circulation of rubber has produced diverse forms of social relations throughout the history of modern civilization. How does the life story of rubber help us understand global inequality?

Today, rubber farmers in North Sumatra are usually elderly persons as young people prefer working in the cities and leaving their parents struggling with their family land in the villages. The combination of elderly farmers and old rubber trees makes up for low productivity of the overall smallholder rubber sector in this area.</p></p><a href=/blog/old_man_old_trees/ class="mt-4 inline-block text-brandBlue hover:underline">Read More →</a></article><article class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-xl transition"><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800"><a href=/blog/gunny_sacks/ class=hover:text-brandBlue>Gunny sack and the precarious workers behind the circular economy</a></h2><p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">May 5, 2018</p><p class=text-gray-700><p>Yu Djilah, a mother of three, could no longer find a job as a seasonal farmworker since the expansion of the male-dominated sugar cane plantations to her village.
