Does knowing more about activist persecution make them more critical of elites, more likely to act, or more inclined to retreat?

The results speak to broader dynamics unfolding across Indonesia—how trust varies by region, how past experience shapes future action, and why raising awareness alone may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Inequality Tells Us About Democracy in Indonesia?</title><link>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/inequality_democracy_indonesia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/inequality_democracy_indonesia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I used to believe that inequality weakens democracy. The more unequal a society becomes, the more disconnected people feel from the political system. Why would someone vote if the decisions are always made by the wealthy few?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I started looking at data from Indonesia, that belief started to shift. What I found was more complex, and in some places, more hopeful than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inequality does not always silence people. Sometimes, it wakes them up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
