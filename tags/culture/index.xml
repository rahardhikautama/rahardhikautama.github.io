This tree holds an essential role in sustaining the traditional culture in the island through its utility as the wood for building fishmonger canoes and traditional houses.

&lt;p&gt;Mama Ina committed to planting the Ingul trees in the forest area that surrounds her village for almost two years. She hopes to preserve the traditional culture by making sure there will be sufficient supply of Ingul woods in the island for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
