Does knowing more about activist persecution make them more critical of elites, more likely to act, or more inclined to retreat? These questions lie at the heart of an experimental study we conducted with Indonesian youth, designed to explore the relationship between awareness, political trust, and civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a simple but carefully structured experiment, we examined how a brief informational message about activist repression shaped young people’s attitudes. The results speak to broader dynamics unfolding across Indonesia—how trust varies by region, how past experience shapes future action, and why raising awareness alone may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
