The more unequal a society becomes, the more disconnected people feel from the political system. Why would someone vote if the decisions are always made by the wealthy few?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I started looking at data from Indonesia, that belief started to shift. What I found was more complex, and in some places, more hopeful than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inequality does not always silence people. Sometimes, it wakes them up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why does land reform thrive in some countries but fail in others?</title><link>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/why_land_reform_fails/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/why_land_reform_fails/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we need to step back and ask, “Why do we need land reform in the first place to solve the global poverty problem?” Land reform can improve agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods. Since the majority of the global poor population lives in rural areas and depends on the agricultural sector for their livelihood, land reform can potentially help alleviate global poverty. According to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview"&gt;World Bank report&lt;/a&gt;, agricultural development is one of the most powerful tools to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Implementing land reform can lead to growth in the agricultural sector, which has been demonstrated to be &lt;a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/700061468334490682/ending-poverty-and-hunger-by-2030-an-agenda-for-the-global-food-system"&gt;two to four times more effective in increasing the income of the poorest&lt;/a&gt; compared to other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Social Life of Rubber</title><link>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/social_life_rubber/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rahardhika.com/blog/social_life_rubber/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Natural rubber remains an important global commodity despite the increasing consumption of its synthetic counterpart. Rubber is native to the Amazonian rainforest, it was smuggled to Britain in 1876 and massively cultivated in Southeast Asian plantations from then to now. The circulation of rubber has produced diverse forms of social relations throughout the history of modern civilization. How does the life story of rubber help us understand global inequality?

She used to work for food-crop farmers cultivating rice, corn, and soybean. In the past decade, Indonesia saw an increasing trend of importing these commodities and thus threatening the local commodity market, which further compelled affluent landowners to convert their farms into sugar cane plantations in her village.

&lt;p&gt;I took the first two photos while I asked them if they would have the slightest chance of pursuing the local government to deal with the water pollution problem; they laughed at my question.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
